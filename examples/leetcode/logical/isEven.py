def is_Even(n): 
    return n % 2 == 0

# Simple example of a logical algorithm. It returns True if n is even. 
# % computes the remainder of numbers, if the remainder is equal to 0 when divided by 2, it means it is an even number.
# Basically, this is called a logical algorithm (logical reasoning).
